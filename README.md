# Lua Projects

**Lua project** is a collection of four interactive programs written in Lua:  
1. **Calculator** – A basic calculator.
2. **Rock, paper, scissors** – A game to play against the computer.
3. **Notes-program** - A simple program to take notes.
4. **Backup-system** - A simple backup system.

**How to use backup-system**
- Install LuaFileSystem (LFS) if you don’t have it: ***luarocks install luafilesystem***
- Run the code.
- Enter the source directory.
- Enter the backup directory.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Note:** These projects are built using Lua, a simple, fast, and lightweight scripting language. They are fun examples of interactive programs that you can run directly in your Lua environment.

## Our Mission
The goal of these projects is to demonstrate basic Lua scripting and logic, while also giving you the opportunity to test and modify code. Lua’s simplicity and ease of use make it ideal for beginners.
