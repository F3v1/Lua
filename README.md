# Lua Projects: Calculator & Rock, Paper, Scissors

**Lua Projects** is a collection of two interactive games written in Lua:  
1. **Calculator** – A basic calculator to perform arithmetic operations.
2. **Rock, Paper, Scissors** – A fun game to play against the computer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Note:** These projects are built using Lua, a simple, fast, and lightweight scripting language. They are fun examples of interactive programs that you can run directly in your Lua environment.

## Why These Projects?
These projects are simple, yet fun applications that showcase the power and simplicity of Lua scripting. They provide:
- A basic **Calculator** for performing essential mathematical operations.
- An engaging **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game to enjoy some casual fun while learning.

## Our Mission
The goal of these projects is to demonstrate basic Lua scripting and logic, while also giving you the opportunity to test and modify code. Lua’s simplicity and ease of use make it ideal for beginners.
